    <div class="textProject">
        <p>As part of my summer internship at Dolby's Enterprise Applications team, I completed a full-stack website using the .NET Core MVC framework in C# for external partner companies.
          The motivation for this is to provide an external service to the employees of Dolby partner companies.
        </p>
        <p>
          BACKEND: As the developer for this project, I used Okta's REST API for user authentication and management.
          Using Visual Studio, I built this website and hosted it on a Windows server.
        </p>
        <p>
          FRONTEND: For the frontend, I used the Bootstrap Library as well as Dolby's CSS library to create a interactive user interface.
          The frontend was programmed in HTML/CSS/Javascript, with C# embedded using Razor pages.

      <p>
        Before programming or designing the site, I discussed the BOD (Business Object Document) with members of the business, marketing, and legal team.
        We designed the website around employees of partner companies and optimized for user usability.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to allow for an easy user experience, I decided to use a simple color scheme with 4 colors of high contrast.
        All elements relevant to the user were based on the design of the main Dolby website.
        By doing so, I allowed for greater coherency in usability for users.
        In order to show transparency to users, I created a cookie banner and added cookies to the site for user tracking.

    <h1 class="titleProject computerText" style="text-align: center">TESTING AND EVALUATION</h1>
    <p>In order to test the website, I used a set of common internet browsers in order to ensure that the UI of the website was uniform across all browsers.
      I used Google Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Internet Explorer.
    </p>
    <p>Testing the backend was slightly more complicated.
    To test the user interaction, I created several fake user accounts and simulated possible user errors.
    I also tested the site by randomly closing the browser during different steps of the user creation process.
    Then for further user testing by the intended users, I whitelisted a fake company and tested creating accounts for the fake company.

    <h1 class="titleProject computerText" style="text-align: center">FINAL THOUGHTS</h1>
    <p>As my first software-related internship and project at Dolby, I found this project very rewarding.
      I gained firsthand experience in the development process, from ideation to iteration and publishing.
      During this project, I received knowledgeable feedback that let me view user design and backend programming differently.
      I continued the next half of my internship developing a cross-platform mobile application for Android and
